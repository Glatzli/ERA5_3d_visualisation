# ERA5 3d visualisation:
## Goal:
Enable 3d visualization of weather fronts. In teaching at ACINN the 3d view is covered pretty 
create a webpage with 3 plots of the ECMWF ERA5 Data: 
-  horizontal view
-  vertical west-east cut
-  vertical north-south cut 

We included plots of temperature & geopotential (horizontal) with the corresponding wind vectors
in each plane. We also included the model topography of the ECMWF model to get an overview of the
mountain-related processes. 

For the data we used ERA5 Reanalysis data of the Copernicus site.
To create the webpage we used panel, a first draft was done in html/javascript as a string in python.
