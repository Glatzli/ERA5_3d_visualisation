create a 3D visualization of the ECMWF ERA5 Reanalysis Data:

Idea:
We want to make a tool for visualizing the vertical cross-section of fronts.
First, plot geopotential as contour lines with temperature or relative humidity as colors.
=> Create an interactive webmap with 3 plots of the model output data:

1. horizontal view 
2. vertical cross-section west-east
3. vertical cross-section south-north

IMPORTANT:

files are saved in ../era5horiz_plots/ folder, create the folder for plots first!
